      "#### Step 1: Prepare the Chicken Masala (Curry)\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  Heat the oil in a large, heavy-bottom pot. Add the thinly sliced onions and fry them until they turn golden brown. Take out half of these fried onions and set them aside for later garnish.\n",
      "2.  Add the ginger-garlic paste to the pot with the remaining onions and saut√© for 1-2 minutes until fragrant.\n",
      "3.  Now, add the chopped tomatoes and cook them until they become soft and mashable.\n",
      "4.  Add the red chili powder, turmeric powder, coriander powder, cumin powder, and salt. Mix everything well and cook for a minute.\n",
      "5.  Add the chicken pieces to the pot. Cook the chicken for about 5-7 minutes, stirring until it changes color and turns white.\n",
      "6.  Whisk the plain yogurt well, then add it to the chicken. Also add the slit green chilies, chopped mint leaves, and chopped coriander leaves.\n",
      "7.  Mix everything gently, then cover the pot with a lid. Cook on low heat for about 20-25 minutes, or until the chicken is tender and you see the oil separating from the gravy.\n",
      "8.  Remove the lid and let it simmer uncovered for another 5 minutes to reduce any extra liquid. Your chicken masala is now ready. Set it aside.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Step 2: Boil the Rice\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  Rinse the basmati rice well under cold water. Then, soak it in water for about 30 minutes. This helps the rice grains lengthen nicely when cooked.\n",
      "2.  In a separate large pot, bring plenty of water to a boil. Add salt, bay leaf, whole cloves, green cardamoms, and the cinnamon stick to the boiling water.\n",
      "3.  Drain the soaked rice and add it to the boiling water. Cook the rice until it is about 70-80% done. The rice grains should be mostly cooked but still have a slight bite to them, not fully soft.\n",
      "4.  Carefully drain all the water from the rice and set it aside.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Step 3: Layer the Biryani\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  Take a large, heavy-bottom pot (the same one you used for chicken masala if it's big enough, or a fresh one). Spread a layer of the cooked chicken masala at the bottom of the pot.\n",
      "2.  Now, spread a layer of half of the boiled rice evenly over the chicken masala.\n",
      "3.  Sprinkle some of the reserved fried onions, a few fresh mint leaves, and coriander leaves over the rice.\n",
      "4.  In a small bowl, mix the yellow or orange food color with the 2 tablespoons of milk. Drizzle this colored milk over the rice.\n",
      "5.  Repeat the layers: add the remaining chicken masala, then the rest of the boiled rice.\n",
      "6.  Sprinkle more fried onions, fresh mint, and coriander on top, and drizzle any remaining colored milk.\n",
      "7.  Cover the pot tightly with a lid. You can also seal the edges of the lid with some dough or aluminum foil to keep the steam inside.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Step 4: Steam (Dum Cooking)\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  Place a flat pan (like a griddle or tawa) on your stove and heat it on medium.\n",
      "2.  Place the biryani pot on top of this hot pan. This helps to distribute the heat evenly and prevent the bottom from burning.\n",
      "3.  Cook on very low heat for 20-25 minutes. This steaming process (called \"dum\") allows the flavors to blend beautifully and the rice to finish cooking perfectly.\n",
      "4.  After 20-25 minutes, turn off the heat but do not open the lid immediately. Let the biryani sit, still covered, for another 10-15 minutes. This resting time is important for the flavors to settle.\n",
