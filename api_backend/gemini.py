### 🍳 Cooking Instructions

#### Step 1: Prepare the Chicken Masala

1. Heat oil in a large pot and fry sliced onions until golden brown.
2. Add ginger-garlic paste and sauté for 1–2 minutes.
3. Add chopped tomatoes and cook until soft.
4. Add red chili powder, turmeric, coriander powder, cumin powder, and salt. Mix well.
5. Add chicken pieces and cook for 5–7 minutes until chicken turns white.
6. Add whisked yogurt, green chilies, mint, and coriander leaves.
7. Cover and cook on low heat for about 20–25 minutes until chicken is tender and oil separates.
8. Remove lid and simmer uncovered for 5 minutes to reduce excess liquid. Set aside.

#### Step 2: Boil the Rice

1. Rinse the rice and soak it for 30 minutes.
2. In a separate large pot, boil water with salt, bay leaf, cardamom, cloves, and cinnamon.
3. Add soaked rice and cook until it’s **70–80% done** (grains should break with a bite).
4. Drain the rice and set aside.

#### Step 3: Layer the Biryani

1. In a large heavy-bottom pot, add a layer of chicken masala.
2. Add a layer of half the rice over it.
3. Sprinkle some fried onions, mint, coriander, and milk mixed with food color.
4. Repeat with another layer of chicken and rice.
5. Cover the pot tightly with a lid or dough to seal.

#### Step 4: Steam (Dum)

1. Heat a flat pan (tawa) and place the biryani pot on top.
2. Steam on very low heat (dum) for 20–25 minutes.
3. Turn off the heat and let it sit covered for 10 more minutes.
